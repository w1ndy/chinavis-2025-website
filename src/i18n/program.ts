However, traditional methods are forced to adopt spatiotemporal sparse sampling due to storage limitations, leading to the loss of dynamic features. Existing data-driven models lack deep embedding of physical knowledge and uncertainty quantification, making them difficult to meet engineering credibility requirements. To address these issues, this talk proposes an innovative framework combining 'data-driven + physics-guided + uncertainty quantification' and conducts the following research: (1) Based on the self-developed NNW series CFD software, a high-fidelity dataset HFR-Beach balancing grid resolution and numerical accuracy is constructed to provide high-quality data support for intelligent models; (2) From data representation, model architecture, and training strategy, physics-guided intelligent model design methods (PCSAGAN, PgTransGAN, PEINR) are proposed to enhance model interpretability and generalization; (3) Bayesian methods are introduced to establish a credibility evaluation system integrating uncertainty quantification, ensuring the scientific and reliability of intelligent model decisions. The research results form high-precision, interpretable high-fidelity visual analytics tools, promoting the paradigm shift of intelligent flow field analysis from 'black-box fitting' to 'white-box decision-making'.",

In this report, we will introduce a tool for automatically constructing immersive science communication animations for scientific volume data, which only requires users to interactively interpret one or two 2D slices of volume data (with the help of mature image processing algorithms). The interpretive visualization results on 2D slices will be automatically migrated to 3D immersive space, avoiding users' direct interactive interpretation in 3D space. Compared with state-of-the-art image-to-image style transfer neural networks, the proposed method can be constructed on desktop PCs without time-consuming training.

This study takes a digital humanities perspective for the first time, systematically sorting out the equal renown phenomena of 633 painters from the Three Kingdoms to modern times in historical literature using quantitative methods, constructing a cross-era, cross-regional social network map of equal renown painters. Based on text mining, Transformer language models, and social network analysis (SNA), the "transmissive equal renown" theory is proposed and systematically verified, revealing the hidden artistic transmission paths formed through indirect connections between painters that lurk beneath traditional literature. At the same time, using D3.js and Three.js technologies, an interactive visualization platform called "Mapping the Universe" was designed and developed, presenting the complex and dynamic equal renown networks in history with rich and intuitive visual interaction methods. This not only bridges the gap in macro-analysis of traditional literature verification methods, but also provides new technical paths and theoretical paradigms for Chinese painting history research in the digital humanities era.',

This report will focus on how perceptual technologies such as brain-computer interfaces, physiological sensing, and biofeedback are introduced into interactive art design to capture audience emotions, physiological states, and cognitive intentions, thereby shaping artistic experiences with human-machine empathy characteristics. At the same time, combining my research experience in user interface and behavioral data analysis, I will explore the core role of interactive data (such as trigger paths, behavioral rhythms, spatial movement, etc.) in the construction of work generation logic and interactive mechanisms. Through multiple practical cases - including AI-driven immersive environments, generative narrative systems based on EEG and behavioral perception, and data recording and response systems for audience behavioral trajectories in exhibition spaces - this report presents how perceptual and interactive data serve as creative materials and social media, inspiring new forms and expressions at the intersection of art and technology. In the era context of "tide generating myriad phenomena," we hope to use these fusion explorations to promote new media art to more deeply intervene in the scene of human perception and technological evolution.',

Those who "establish symbols" refine the principles of heaven and earth with abstract symbols; those who "seek symbols" examine the forms of all things with concrete diagrams. From the mysterious schemas of hexagrams to the surveyed maps of mountains and rivers, from herbal images for investigating things to achieve knowledge to local gazetteers for practical governance, these visualization practices not only constitute the visual genealogy of ancient ancestors\' knowledge inheritance, but also highlight the unique visual thinking mode of Chinese civilization. The report will use "symbol" as the pivot to outline the evolutionary trajectory of visualization thinking from pre-Qin to Ming and Qing dynasties, analyzing the dual value of design thinking in ancient Chinese visualization systems: at the visual cognitive level, it constructs an organic connection between abstract concepts and concrete representations; in the information dissemination dimension, it establishes an efficient information transmission paradigm.

                  zh: "中国古代信息图像系统作为传统知识传播的重要载体，展现了独特的视觉认知体系。以中医图像为代表的信息图像，通过系统化的视觉语言，实现了抽象医学知识的具象化表达。从图像类型学来看，这些信息图像可分为五大功能类别：解剖图示（如脏腑经络图）、诊疗图谱（如针灸穴位图）、药物图鉴（如本草绘图）、养生导引图（如八段锦图谱）以及综合性的医学百科插图。这种分类体系反映了古人系统化整理医学知识的智慧。在视觉语言方面，这些图像形成了独特的符号系统：采用平面化的造型语言表现立体结构，运用象征性符号传递抽象概念，通过序列化构图展示动态过程，并融入艺术化的审美表达。这种记述方式既保证了信息的准确传达，又兼顾了视觉的审美需求。从历史演进维度观察，这些信息图像的发展与印刷技术进步密切相关。唐宋时期的雕版印刷推动了医学图像的标准化，明清时期的套色印刷则丰富了图像的表现力。值得注意的是，这些图像在保持核心医学信息的同时，其表现形式经历了从宗教神秘主义向科学实用主义的转变，最终形成了兼具专业性和普及性的视觉传播体系。以《内景图》为例，其演变过程完整呈现了古代信息图像的转型轨迹：从最初充满道教符号的宗教图解，逐步发展为标注精确的医学教学图，最终演变为通俗易懂的养生指导图。这种转型不仅反映了医学知识的民主化进程，也展现了中国古代信息图像强大的适应性和生命力。",
                  en: "The ancient Chinese information image system, as an important carrier of traditional knowledge dissemination, demonstrates a unique visual cognitive system. Information images represented by traditional Chinese medicine images achieve concrete expression of abstract medical knowledge through systematic visual language. From the perspective of image typology, these information images can be divided into five major functional categories: anatomical diagrams (such as visceral meridian charts), diagnostic and therapeutic atlases (such as acupuncture point charts), pharmaceutical atlases (such as herbal illustrations), health guidance diagrams (such as Baduanjin charts), and comprehensive medical encyclopedia illustrations. This classification system reflects the wisdom of ancient people in systematically organizing medical knowledge. In terms of visual language, these images form a unique symbol system: using flat modeling language to represent three-dimensional structures, using symbolic symbols to convey abstract concepts, showing dynamic processes through serialized composition, and incorporating artistic aesthetic expression. This descriptive method ensures accurate information transmission while considering visual aesthetic needs. From the perspective of historical evolution, the development of these information images is closely related to the progress of printing technology. Block printing in the Tang and Song periods promoted the standardization of medical images, while color printing in the Ming and Qing periods enriched the expressive power of images. It is worth noting that while maintaining core medical information, the expressive forms of these images experienced a transformation from religious mysticism to scientific pragmatism, ultimately forming a visual communication system that is both professional and popular. Taking the 'Inner Landscape Diagram' as an example, its evolutionary process completely presents the transformation trajectory of ancient information images: from the initial religious diagrams full of Taoist symbols, gradually developing into precisely annotated medical teaching diagrams, and finally evolving into easy-to-understand health guidance diagrams. This transformation not only reflects the democratization process of medical knowledge, but also demonstrates the strong adaptability and vitality of ancient Chinese information images.",

In this paradigm, visualization is no longer a static diagram of results, but a dynamic tool and mechanized procedure deeply embedded in the computing process and serving problem-solving. We define this unique tradition as "visual algorithms." The report focuses on mathematics and astronomy, deeply analyzing the internal logic and practical forms of "visual algorithms." In mathematics, it analyzes how ancient people used counting rods as computing tools and made them symbolic and visual, and how they transformed geometric proofs into operable visual algorithms. In astronomy, it examines how observation methods such as gnomon shadow measurement transform spatiotemporal data into intuitive visual relationships, and focuses on how the combined use of "licheng" (quick calculation tables), "xicao" (operation manuals), and "suanshi" (calculation templates) in Ming and Qing calendar calculations constitutes a complete and highly stylized astronomical calculation visualization system. These practices not only demonstrate superb computational skills, but also reflect the "mechanization" and "stylization" thinking modes of ancient Chinese computation. In addition, from the perspective of visual analytics, some computational methods in ancient Chinese mathematics and astronomy can be called "computation-guided visualization" systems of the pre-digital era - an executable, interactive computing system used to drive computation, construct proofs, and simulate complex calculations.',

Due to the complexity of high-dimensional embedding features, dimensionality reduction (DR) methods must be employed to explore alignment relationships in multimodal embeddings. However, existing DR visual analysis methods fail to consider cross-modal alignment metrics, leading to problems: occlusion by noise points in dense regions, inaccurate metric heatmaps, and insufficient support for multi-scale interactive exploration. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel dimensionality reduction visualization system - DKMap, which achieves interactive exploration of multimodal embeddings through Dynamic Kernel Enhanced Projection. First, we propose a parameterized supervised t-SNE that integrates post-projection metric heatmap estimation into the projection learning process, thereby improving the accuracy of multimodal mapping. Second, to support multi-scale exploration with dynamic scaling and progressive enhancement of local details, we combine generalized t-kernel α parameter optimization based on validation constraints with quadtree-based multi-resolution techniques to achieve reliable kernel parameter adjustment while ensuring low overfitting. DKMap is a cross-platform visualization tool that includes a web system for interactive exploration and a Python library suitable for computational notebook analysis. We validated DKMap's versatility and scalability through three usage scenarios, including: visualizing the million-scale text-to-image corpus DiffusionDB, comparative evaluation of generative models with different architectures (Unet-Diffusion and Diffusion Transformer), and exploring the billion-scale pre-training dataset LAION-400M.",

Even the latest reactive LLM-assisted systems only provide help when explicitly requested by the user, making them insufficiently intelligent to offer suggestions when analysts need them the most. To support deeper and broader insight exploration, we propose a novel proactive visual analytics framework, where an LLM-based UI agent autonomously anticipates users' difficulties and offers timely assistance. To determine when users need proactive help, what assistance they require, and how the agent should intervene, we first conducted a formative study to analyze help-seeking behaviors from interaction logs and distilled key design requirements for proactive agents in visual analytics systems. We develop a three-stage UI agent pipeline including perception, reasoning, and acting. The agent autonomously perceives users' needs from interaction logs, providing tailored suggestions and intuitive guidance through interactive exploration of the system. We implemented the framework in two representative types of visual analytics systems, demonstrating its generalizability, and evaluated the effectiveness through an algorithm evaluation, case and expert study and a user study.

Generative models learn high-dimensional latent spaces to enable sampling of infinite numbers of samples from them.

To solve this problem, we propose Latent Space Map, which maps the latent space to a two-dimensional plane and preserves its key characteristics, helping users locate samples with desired properties in the latent space through visual guidance. We applied this map in model diagnosis and product design scenarios and verified its effectiveness. In addition, based on this idea, we further propose RobustMap, a visual exploration method for adversarial robustness of deep neural networks based on generative latent space. This method significantly improves the application value of generated samples in deep learning model analysis by using generated samples to visualize the robustness of deep neural networks.",

Many quality metrics concerning data pattern, perception, and aesthetics are proposed, and respective optimization algorithms are developed. However, the optimization problems related to ordering are often difficult to solve (e.g., TSP is NP-complete), and developing specialized optimization algorithms is costly. In this paper, we propose Versatile Ordering Network (VON), which automatically learns the strategy to order given a quality metric. VON uses the quality metric to evaluate its solutions, and leverages reinforcement learning with a greedy rollout baseline to improve itself. This keeps the metric transparent and allows VON to optimize over different metrics. Additionally, VON uses the attention mechanism to collect information across scales and reposition the data points with respect to the current context. This allows VONs to deal with data points following different distributions. We examine the effectiveness of VON under different usage scenarios and metrics. The results demonstrate that VON can produce comparable results to specialized solvers.",

The model was developed through a grounded theory analysis of the statements explaining the reasoning behind the likes of visualization, which were recorded from a preliminary study. Informed by coding the statements from two dimensions including scopes and design patterns concerning visualization, our model consists of three levels: depicting the "look" of a visualization (e.g., artistic style and color scheme); interpreting the "flesh and bones" of a visualization (e.g., visualization and narrative); and elucidating the "heart and soul" of a visualization (e.g., insights and conclusion).

However, due to the limited accuracy of genomic prediction models, breeders still need to combine their experience with the models to identify regulatory genes that control traits and select hybrids, which remains a time-consuming process. To ease this process, in this paper, we proposed a visual analysis method to facilitate interactive hybrid rice breeding. Regulatory gene identification and hybrid selection naturally ensemble a dual-analysis task. Therefore, we developed a parametric dual projection method with theoretical guarantees to facilitate interactive dual analysis. Based on this dual projection method, we further developed a gene visualization and a hybrid visualization to verify the identified regulatory genes and hybrids. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through the quantitative evaluation of the parametric dual projection method, identified regulatory genes and desired hybrids in the case study, and positive feedback from breeders.",

In this work, we address these shortcomings by first analyzing 400 out-of-play clips from eight major tennis broadcasts to establish a design framework for tennis-specific camera movements that facilitate embedded visualizations. We refined our approach by analyzing 25 VR animation clips and comparing their shot and motion patterns with those of traditional tennis broadcasts, revealing key differences that guided our VR adaptations. Based on data extracted from the broadcast videos, we reconstruct a simulated game that captures the players' and ball's motion and trajectories. Leveraging this design framework and processing pipeline, we develope Beyond the Broadcast, a VR tennis viewing system that integrates embedded visualizations with adaptive camera motions to construct a comprehensive and engaging narrative. Our system dynamically overlays tactical information and key match events in real time, enhancing viewer comprehension and engagement while maintaining high immersion and comfort.

                  en: "Designing synthetic routes for novel molecules is pivotal in various fields like medicine and chemistry. In this process, researchers need to explore a set of synthetic reactions to transform starting molecules into intermediates step by step until the target novel molecule is obtained. However, designing synthetic routes presents challenges for researchers. First, researchers need to make decisions among numerous possible synthetic reactions at each step, considering various criteria (e.g., yield, experimental duration, and the count of experimental steps) to construct the synthetic route. Second, they must consider the potential impact of one choice at each step on the overall synthetic route. To address these challenges, we proposed SynthLens, a visual analytics system to facilitate the iterative construction of synthetic routes by exploring multiple possibilities for synthetic reactions at each step of construction. Specifically, we have introduced a tree-form visualization in SynthLens to compare and evaluate all the explored routes at various exploration steps, considering both the exploration step and multiple criteria. Our system empowers researchers to consider their construction process comprehensively, guiding them toward promising exploration directions to complete the synthetic route. We validated the usability and effectiveness of SynthLens through a quantitative evaluation and expert interviews, highlighting its role in facilitating the design process of synthetic routes. Finally, we discussed the insights of SynthLens to inspire other multi-criteria decision-making scenarios with visual analytics.",
